*** version 2012.11.18

- fixed a bug in ReadAll where the function didn't add the proper
offset to receiving buffer in second and next packets

*** version 2012.06.03

- added ReadAll function that reads the data until the buffer is
all filled up, not returning earlier (unless there was an error)

*** version 2011.10.13

- changed all the "unsigned char*" in the interface to proper 
"void*" or "const void*" types

- fixed a bug where WriteAll would enter and infinite loop
if the reciepient would disconnect while using a non-blocking
socket (thanks to . for pointing this out)

*** version 2011.10

- initial [official] public release
